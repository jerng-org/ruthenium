## Meta

The following nouns are asserted to being equivalent for the purpose of this
README:

-   software framework
-   software development kit
-   software design pattern
-   kit (for brevity)

## Kit

This is meant to be a *language-agnostic* and *runtime-agnostic* kit. This kit
may be implemented in any / many languages and runtimes.

This kit addresses the complexities of developing *web applications*. 

## Reference Implementation

Since the *lingua franca* of the web is ECMAScript, the *reference
implementation* is currently being draughted in ECMAScript.  Since the dominant
runtime for ECMAScript is currently NodeJS, the reference implementation is
adequately coherent with that. Specifically the reference implementation is
implemented in the NodeJS runtime on AWS Lambda, because well, currently AWS is
the dominant public cloud (and that's how I ended up developing on it).

## Motivation

I've been building webpages since the year 2000 or thenabouts, and using
web-development frameworks since 2009, and I hope to god that I won't have to
redesign another web-development framework after this. Hopefully I'll be able to
just reimplement the same pattern in whatever language or runtime I need to work
in henceforth.

### My Context

This is not expected to be your context.

Consciousness is boring because in the long run, there is only one way to think
about anything, and local instances are just results of upstream idiosyncracies
in the evolution of things that think. Web development is probably the same.
There will be at the end of time only one correct way to write a web development
app, because it is the quickest, stripped of cultural nuances. We just don't
know what it is yet, because the web wasn't designed in a very proper fashion,
and so we have hundreds of frameworks (attempts) to make sense of the mess. Well
that's the nature of evolution, I suppose. Most of these frameworks will die a
boring and uncelebrated mess. Probably, so will this one. But for the span of
their respective lives all frameworks are expected to be useful - I suppose
frameworks are people too.
